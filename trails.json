    "description": "Historically, the most frequent approach to Eagle Lake has been via a scramble from Barclay Lake that is not suitable for most hikers. One story holds that Harvey Manning -- angry that logging in the lower Eagle Creek basin made road access to Eagle Lake via the Fisherman's route too easy -- intentionally omitted directions to this trailhead in his guidebook. The roadside parking area is marked with a “National Forest Wilderness” sign that bears a map of the region. The sign erroneously indicates “Barclay Lake #1055,” but knowledgeable hikers have indicated the location of the trailhead and the trail route with black marker. If you see this wrong sign, then you are in the right place!",

    "description": "This hike has a little bit of everything.To reach Little Joe Lake, hike Gold Creek Trail with gradual ups and downs to the Alaska Lake turnoff at about 5 miles. The main trail goes left and uphill to Alaska Lake. Take the other way. The Joe Lake trail starts here and goes straight ahead into the open meadows of slide alder and vine maple. This is where the work begins as the trail is no longer maintained past this point. Follow this rough trail around Alaska Mountain paying careful attention to where the main trail is (survey tape in trees marks the way). You will have to duck, crawl, and plow your way through this tangle of brush and the occasional downed log. Watch your step as there are lots of rocks in the trail that will twist an ankle. It's a pretty tedious trek through here so slow down and take your time. After about two miles, you will encounter a beautiful waterfall on your left. Once you cross the water you'll be on the right side the waterfall and the trail is no nonsense at this point. It goes straight up. You will not need hiking poles and coming back down almost guarantees removal of your pack and sliding it down in front of you with a rope. Once you have made it to the top, a plethora of campsites await you and if you are there in midsummer, squadrons of mosquitoes. Aside from the lake and meadows surrounding the lake, there are also several small ponds surrounding the lake. -Side trip 1, at the Alaska Lake trail, there is an abandoned gold mine about 500' above the valley bottom. Look for it to the right of the Alaska Lake Trail. You can only see it from the bottom of the hill. Take a good look at where it is and then look for a faint trail that leads that direction off the Alaska Lake Trail. The mine has about 6 of water in it during the summer and can be explored without flashlights. -Side trip 2 once at Joe Lake, the crest trail is a few hundred feet above the lake, the short route up is at the opposite end of the lake through the trees, but the no nonsense route up is right up the steep meadow or chute at the base of Huckleberry mountain. To the North of the lake on the PCT, there are numerous meadows and ponds to explore. Views are pretty good too.",

    "description": "Early in the season, head here. This trail is haphazardly maintained and routefinding on its upper stretches can (and does) prove difficult. But for good routefinders and those who don't mind an occasional deadfall, it's a good early-season route to the high country of Alaska Lake. Even hikers who opt not to push on to Alaska Lake will enjoy the valley hike as it explores the creek basin and its multitude of beaver ponds and flower-filled clearings. The route follows the road as it heads north, deeper into the Gold Creek valley. Land on both sides of this road is privately owned, so don't wander off it for the first 0.5 mile. Past the end of the maintained road you'll find yourself on an old, abandoned miners track. This fading roadway peters out in another 0.25 mile, leaving you on a wide single-track trail",

But enter fall, when the change of season ushers in majestic color and cooler temps, it's the ideal time to hit this high-alpine trail before the snow starts falling again. From the get-go, the Shriner Peak Trail steadily ascends 3,424 feet in 4.25 miles. Bring lots of water--you'll need it , and there aren't many sources along the way. The trail runs parallel to Panther Creek through shade Douglas-fir, cedar, and hemlock for 0.75 miles before entering an old burn area. Traverse this shadeless stretch for another mile to a steep series of switchbacks to the top of a ridge under Shriner Peak. ",

Today, the lounging pools along the river are gone, but hot water still seeps out of the rocks before merging into the icy-cold waters of the Ohanapecosh River. The trail takes off from the visitor center and wanders through the lush, moss-laden forests on the east bank of the Ohanapecosh River. The trail is well graded and easy to walk, even for kids with short legs and shorter attention spans. The route explores some wonderful forest environments, with a variety of plant life to examine.",

The trail ascends through the little used Corral Pass Campground at a gentle grade. The easy path ascends very gently through thin stands of tall, pointed alpine trees, and soon comes to the one and only switchback on the whole route. Passing through forest and meadows after a mile or so it breaks out on top of the northwest ridge of Castle Mountain.",
