    "description": "Historically, the most frequent approach to Eagle Lake has been via a scramble from Barclay Lake that is not suitable for most hikers. One story holds that Harvey Manning -- angry that logging in the lower Eagle Creek basin made road access to Eagle Lake via the Fisherman's route too easy -- intentionally omitted directions to this trailhead in his guidebook. The roadside parking area is marked with a “National Forest Wilderness” sign that bears a map of the region. The sign erroneously indicates “Barclay Lake #1055,” but knowledgeable hikers have indicated the location of the trailhead and the trail route with black marker. If you see this wrong sign, then you are in the right place!",
